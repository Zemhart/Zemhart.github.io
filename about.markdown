I just a guy that likes video games, soups, sky, beach and mountain. I like some JRPG and racing games likes Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, and Crash Team Racing. For mobile games, currently I hooked on Limbus Company and Library of Ruina.<br>
For soups, I fond of soups that are rich in flavors like soto and gulai. Seeing blue things like sea at the beach or sky makes me calm and happy. I like mountains or highland because usually they are a lot cooler than my home. I also likes variety of music likes Mili's songs, Weekender Girl, and Weekend Roll by halca.

Oh, I also a software engineer that has 6 years experience in accounting SAAS. I was improving multi currency calculation, adding feature to enable payment from purchase invoice, improving reconciliation from invoices and bank statements and improving old inventory calculation system. I also designing new inventory system to scale up with data thats getting bigger every day and hard to handles with old system.<br>
I could say that I familiar with REST API, MVC architecture, distributed system, background job, SQL queries and its optimization. My mose usage tech stacks are Ruby on Rails, MySQL, and Kafka. I also know some Go, Java and Postgres.<br>
For my experiences in earlier year as software engineer, I make scrapers to get news and bank statements. I also create a text summarizer using Recurring Neural Network for my final project as undergraduate students.
